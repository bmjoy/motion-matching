# MotionMatching

## Demo
This video shows the basic locomotion with using the motion matching system. The left subtitle is the real-time matching results. The right part is the real-time controller’s input. There are two lines in the demonstration. The line which is straighter, and smoother is the predicted trajectory, and the other line is the matched trajectory. Both of these two lines are relative to the characters’ current position and rotation
